# Phoenix

Phoenix is a framework, made by RKH LTD team and is the most stupid thing I ever see in my life. 
In 2016, to hire a programmer with 20 years of experience, just to make a PROCEDURAL framework, just because you don't have an idea
what is an Abstract class is, is just something that I don't get it.

Anyway, here I add what some payment processors implementation I have made for them. OOP, of course, and we managed to make it work 
with all they procedural stuff. 

Leaving this repo just as reminder to the future genres.
